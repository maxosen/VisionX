# VisionX
## Overview
This is my entry for Google Solutions Challenge 2020.

VisionX is a camera app that aims to help the blind by identifying and speaking out the objects around them.

It is based on the [Tensorflow Lite Object Detection Android Demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android).

## Build the app using Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio, and from the Welcome screen, select Open an existing Android Studio project.

2. From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and open the project.

3. If it asks you to do a Gradle Sync, click OK.

4. You may also need to install various platforms and tools, if you get errors like "Failed to find target with hash string 'android-21'" and similar. Click the Run button (the green arrow) or select Run > Run 'android' from the top menu. You may need to rebuild the project using Build > Rebuild Project.

5. If it asks you to use Instant Run, click Proceed Without Instant Run.

6. Also, you need to have an Android device plugged in with developer options enabled at this point. See [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) for more details on setting up developer devices.
